# AddToTen
this is a simple techdemo of a game written in Javascript (with the p5 library).  

# Goal of the game

The goal of this game is simple, count the dots on both the mushrooms. Then you push the button with the microphone on it and say the total amount of dots on both mushrooms. If it is correct there is a soundfile who plays. If it is incorrect another soundfile is playing. I used the W3 WebSpeech API for getting the answer.  NOTE: The language is set to Dutch (NL-nl), if your live in another country you must change this accordingly.
